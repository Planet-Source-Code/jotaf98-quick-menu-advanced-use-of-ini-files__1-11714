I didn't include the .ini file in the source code's
folder because WinZip doesn't let me include two
files with the same name in the same archive (even
if they're in separate folders). So, when you try
running QuickMenu from the source code, no
shortcuts will appear (because there's no .ini file
with them). This can be easily solved by copying
QuickMenu.ini from the main folder to the source
code folder.
