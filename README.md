### Description

QuickMenu is basically a tray icon that, when you click on it, pops up a handy menu with some shortcuts.

You don't need to modify the menus in the code, it's all in an .ini file (modified in by the program), so instead of having a folder full of shortcut files like most quick menus do, you have a list of shortcuts (where you can modify the name using ANY characters you want and use all the commands available in "Start Menu -> Execute"), with a very easy-to-use interface!

Also features: you can modify the tray icon's image to your own and use separators to better organise your QuickMenu!

Please vote, I worked a lot on this!
